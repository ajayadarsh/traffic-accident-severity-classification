# Traffic Accident Severity Classification using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning classification techniques to predict the severity of traffic accidents using large-scale road accident data.

## What this project demonstrates
- Exploratory data analysis on a high dimensional dataset
- Data preprocessing and feature handling
- Multiple classification pipelines
- Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
- Evaluation using appropriate classification metrics

## Models used
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

The full analysis, experiments and results can be found in 'traffic_accident_classification.ipynb'.
